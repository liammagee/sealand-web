Combination of abundant forest litter created by the prolific growth in the Spring of 1966, strong northerly winds of up to 110 km per hour and extremely hot air created ideal conditions for bushfires. The bushfires swept across the south-east coast of Tasmania and burnt through 264,270 hectares in the state's south in the space of five hours coming within 2 km of central Hobart. Sixty two people lost their lives, and 1400 homes or buildings were destroyed. The fires killed thousands of chickens and sheep among other livestock.  A Royal Commission after the fires found there were 110 fires burning within a 56 km radius of Hobart.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1967 damage at $14 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $610 million.",7/02/1967,7/02/1967,February,1967,Tasmania,Tasmania,Tasmania,,EM-Track; EM-DAT; ICA; Report; http://home.iprimus.com.au/foo7/firestas.html,11,1,0,2,1,0,,,35000,7000,900,62,15000000,101000000,,,,,1400,,128,,80,,,,,,,,,0.05,77000,,,,,,,,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=154,EM-Track,EM-DAT,9,17,22,30,,,,,,,,ICA,Report,,Cyclone,Cyclone Dinah,"TC Dinah initially caused severe damage at Heron Island from inundation due to large NE swells and then the next day from high winds.

It is imperative that heatwaves are included in the disaster information, however, for reasons outlined above accurate statistics as to the actual numbers of deaths and injuries in most instances cannot be provided.",1/12/1972,28/02/1973,February,1973,Southern Australia,South Australia; Victoria,South Australia,Victoria,EM-Track; wiki; PDF - newspaper; Reeves (2010) pg 147; Narn and Fawcett (2013),,0,2,1,1,0,2,100000,,,1000,99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=624,EM-Track,wiki,9,15,32,54,,,,,,,,PDF - newspaper,Reeves (2010) pg 147,,Severe Storm,Severe storm and tornado,,4/11/1973,5/11/1973,November,1973,Brisbane,Queensland,Queensland,,wiki; PDF - newspaper; Holcombe and Moynihan (1978) *report requested*; http://www.brisbanestorms.com/reports_041173.html; Callaghan report (HardenUp),,2,1,0,1,2,2,,5000,300,50,2?,,3286501,,,,1890,500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wiki,PDF - newspaper,5,22,71,122,,,,,,,,Holcombe and Moynihan (1978) *report requested*,http://www.brisbanestorms.com/reports_041173.html,212,Cyclone,Cyclone Wanda and flood,"On 24 January 1974, torrential rain and record breaking floods were a direct result of Tropical Cyclone Wanda, which crossed north of Brisbane.

Very strong winds and hail ruined solid brick houses, holiday shacks and caravans. Cars were pushed sideways along the road. Pine trees up to 30 m tall were uprooted.  There was no loss of life during the event which was considered to be amazing. Eleven people were injured requiring hospital admission, 60 others required hospital treatment.  While Port Broughton incurred the most damage, other areas were also affected by this weather event. Destruction was felt from the mid north to northern Adelaide Plains. Clare experienced severe damage; houses lost their roofs and sheds were demolished in the high winds. Likewise the northern suburbs of Adelaide saw houses unroofed and the trees blown over in areas such Salisbury North, Parafield Gardens, and Munno Para.  The agriculture industry was severely impacted with crops damaged, glass houses broken, grape vines stripped, storage tanks squashed, orchards destroyed and many farmers livelihoods built up over many years were lost within ten minutes.  According to the Bureau of Meteorology Regional Forecasting Centre, the thunderstorm triggered by the trough line that extended across Yorke Peninsula moved over Port Broughton and produced destructive winds. The winds at all levels through the atmosphere were very strong. A thunderstorm is classified as severe if it produces wind gusts of 90 km per hour of more. On this day gusts were much higher with reports of 135 km per hour to 160 km per hour. Isolated large hail coming from very cold air high above the earth's surface was rapidly transported to the surface by downdrafts and accompanied the thunderstorms associated with the trough immediately to the east causing damage to some of Adelaide&rsquo;s northern suburbs.

On 16 February itself, there was low humidity, heat wave conditions and strong to gale force winds. Temperatures varied between high thirties and mid forties over most of eastern South Australia and Victoria with relative humidity generally less than 15 per cent.  The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham&nbsp;- Macedon fire complex. This fire began around 2.00 pm near East Trentham due to two powerlines touching and sparking. The fire moved to the Wombat State Forest and burnt much of Bullengarook. The fire stalled for a while but upon wind change to the south-west the fire picked up again and headed toward Woodend with a 7 m fire front at 8.30 pm. It reached Macedon where people and animals sheltered in the Hotel protected by volunteers. The rest of the town was annihilated. After reaching the top of Mount Macedon it was controlled in an area that was previously burnt on 1 February. Seven people died, 20,000 hectares burnt, 200 homes destroyed in Macedon, 150 on Mount Macedon, 50 in Bullengarook and 20 in Woodend.  3. Otways complex. The fire broke out approximately 3.00 pm at Deans Marsh and moved toward Lorne eventually onto the ridges above the town on and down to the sand dunes with many people taking refuge in the sea. The fire moved to Aireys Inlet where the fibro houses were hit by walls of flame and a gigantic firestorm. The fire moved at extraordinary speed and next hit was Anglesea, where houses were lost but the main part of town was saved. The fire burnt on through the night toward Jan Juc and Torquay and was eventually contained early morning near Bellbrae. Three people were killed and 578 houses and other buildings were lost.  4. Upper Beaconsfield - Cockatoo complex. This fire began in Belgrave Heights south of Mount Dandenong. Half an hour later 10 km away, a fire started in Cockatoo and remained static until later that night. The first fire moved 15 km toward Berwick and Pakenham and firefighters were just beginning to gain control when the wind change came through at 8.30 pm redirecting the fire towards Upper Beaconsfield. Firefighters were caught in terrible circumstances leading to deaths. The Cockatoo fire began to flare at 7.30 pm. The fire went right through the town of Cockatoo as fire trucks had been called away to other fires. There were reports of women and children being sheltered and saved at a local kindergarten. The kindergarden&nbsp;building was later&nbsp;recorded by Heritage Victoria as a building of significance to be protected.&nbsp;In total, 27 people died, 100 were injured and 535 houses and buildings destroyed.  5. Warburton complex. This fire erupted in the foothills of mountain ash forests. The fire began in Millgrove at 7.30 pm and quickly progressed to Warburton. Approximately 200 people took shelter at the local oval and a creek in underground tunnel. Thirty houses were destroyed.  In Victoria in summary, 47 people died, 150,000 hectares burnt, 1620 houses burnt and more than 1500 other buildings were destroyed and 32,400 livestock lost.  South Australia  Major fires were burning by noon on Ash Wednesday, particularly in the Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley 120 km north of Adelaide, and around Mount Gambier, the south-east of the state. By 3.00 pm the situation was extreme. The cold front then hit with winds at 90 to 100 km per hour and the intensity of the fires worsened again. By 9.00 pm rain began to fall and the fires in the Adelaide hills came under control. The fires near Mount Gambier took longer. In total 28 people died, including three CFS volunteer fire fighters, more than 1500 people injured, 383 homes and 200 other buildings destroyed and 160,000 hectares burnt.

On 31 March a tropical low developed south-east of Papua New Guinea. It moved slowly west-southwest and the system deepened reaching tropical cyclone intensity on 1 April. Cyclone Aivu tracked south-east and then south-west at 15-20 km per hour and continued to intensify for some days. The cyclone then weakened but maintained severe tropical cyclone intensity when reaching land south of Townsville. Upon reaching the land, the central pressure was 957 hPa with wind gusts to 200 km per hour and a storm surge of up to 3 m. A person drowned in the accompanying storm surge south of the Burdekin River. The system continued to move west-southwest after landfall and degenerated into a rain depression during the next six hours losing identity two days later.  Cyclone Aivu produced record and near record April rainfall totals over large parts of the coastal and central interior districts of Queensland and some parts of New South Wales. The maximum total recorded rainfalls inland from Mackay over 24 hours were 581 mm. Severe local flooding occurred between Townsville and Mackay during 4 April with a flood peak at Mackay of 7.8 m on 5 April; the major flood peak measured 13.2 m on the Pioneer River upstream from Mackay.  In northern New South Wales, flooding occurred as a result of this cyclone and two people drowned in associated flood waters.

Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away.  On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents' ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period.

Heavy rainfalls intensified over the following days, particularly in the Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie regions.  River systems in the region were at capacity and tidal systems in correlation with the king tides caused further complexities with rising flood water. The following river systems were affected; Richmond, Clarence, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay, Hastings, Manning, Paterson and Hunter. The rising water exceeded levees in Kempsey and the traffic bridge at Kempsey peaked at a height of 6.9 m. Other significant damage included; 94 businesses with an estimated direct cost of $28,000 per business, streets closed to traffic and 100 people evacuated from the Mirriwina Gardens settlement (50 km north-west of Kempsey).  The Clarence River also threatened to exceed levees causing precautionary evacuations of more than 1000 people, including 80 patients from the Grafton Hospital. The Grafton levee bank was able to hold the water within the river system, which finally peaked at 7.75 m.  The effects of the flooding were wide spread and inundations and dislocation of services affected up to 28 local government areas.The Pacific Highway, the main route in many of these regions, was cut for several days. Rail services were also reported as suspended. Furthermore, reports of damage included; Yamba becoming isolated, Gladstone and Smithtown where sewerage infrastructure failed and Ulmarra (population of 470) was ordered to evacuate. Bellingen, Thora, Kaland and Darkwood, South West Rocks, Hat Head, and Crescent Head were isolated and required food and medical drops by helicopter.  The response units included; State Emergency Services (SES) a contingent of 1300 volunteers from 83 units, Rural Fire Service (RFS), New South Wales Fire Brigade (NSWFB), Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA), Police, and Council workers. Additional supporting equipment used in the response included; ten heavy tankers, 12 flood boats, and 11 helicopters.  Estimated costs to roads and bridges was $3 million, water and sewerage infrastructure $500,000.  The enormity of the recovery resulted in the Premier establishing a Government Task Force to coordinate the operation.

The strongest wind gusts during the storm were felt at Bathurst with 93 km per hour, Scone 93 km per hour, Kurnell 94 km per hour and Newcastle 91 km per hour.  The unseasonal cold weather brought snow to some areas of New South Wales where approximately 10-15 cm snow fell in the Snowy Mountains and temperatures reached as low as minus 5&deg;C. On the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra and on the Southern Tablelands, several centimetres of snow settled on the ground. Record low maximum and minimum temperatures occurred over this period, especially in the southern areas of the state.

Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.

The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters.

The first and most severe occurred over 8-9 June. Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea. This trough was directing a humid north-east to south-east air stream across north-east New South Wales and there was a weak low analysed just off the coast near Coffs Harbour on 8 June. The low moved south along the New South Wales coast, before moving out into the Tasman Sea on 10 June 2007.  Thunderstorms caused record breaking flooding in Newcastle, with 164.6 mm of rain falling in 6 hours from 3 pm to 9 pm, causing many shops and businesses to flood and hundreds of cars to be stranded or swept away. This storm event is often associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker (a 40,000 tonne bulk carrier ship) which occurred on 8 June on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle and was not re-floated until 2 July. Approximately 6000 people were evacuated from Maitland (near Newcastle) when it was considered that a levee may have burst.  In the Hunter Valley it was reported as the worst flooding in 52 years. Major flooding in the Hunter River occurred from 8 to 13 June and in the Paterson and Williams River from the 8 to 9 June. Moderate flooding occurred in the Wyong, Colo and Nepean Rivers.  Ferry services were cancelled on Sydney Harbour due to the weather conditions. The Cremorne wharf collapsed and sank due to large ocean swells. Beaches were eroded at many Sydney locations, due to swells up to 14 metres high. High winds blew beach sand over 100 metres inland. Over 200,000 homes reportedly lost power in the Sydney - Newcastle area due to flooding and high winds. Many thousands of homes and businesses lost telephone services when telephone exchanges were flooded.  A natural disaster was declared in the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast areas. There were a total of nine fatalities associated with the storm. Nearly 20,000 calls for assistance were made to the State Emergency Service.

Areas of raised dust were reported from the western half of the state, with visibility down to 200 m in some places.  The heaviest rainfall totals were from Falls Creek (Rocky Valley Dam) with 50 mm and Wilsons Promontory with 26 mm. The storm sent vegetation and debris flying, caused major disruption to Melbourne traffic and public transport systems and&nbsp;extensive damage to the electricity distribution network. Lanes were closed on the Westgate bridge where wind gusts were close to 120 km per hour, many traffic lights were out and conditions on the roads were chaotic. Several boats were washed ashore at Mornington, where large waves were observed.  There were reports that two people died as a result of this storm in Victoria.  More than 9,500 requests for assistance were received by emergency service agencies across the State between 2-7 April 2008 as a result of this event.  The Department of Human Services (DHS) coordinated Red Cross and local government to support the community with recovery, distributing 864 personal hardship grants totalling $240,115.

By January 2011 extensive flooding had occurred to 75 per cent of the state and a disaster zone was declared. In total, 33 people lost their lives in flood and cyclone events and three people were still listed missing as of March 2012.  On 25 December 2010, Cyclone Tasha crossed the northern Queensland coast and brought disaster to every river system south of the Tropic of Capricorn and as far west as Longreach and Charleville.  The flooding engulfed Alpha, Jericho, Chinchilla, Dalby, Theodore, Warwick, Bundaberg, Gayndah, Munduberra, Emerald, Rockhampton, Condamine and St George. The Condamine River, the Balonne River, the Burnett River, the Comet River, the Dawson River and the Nagoa River reached flood peaks never before recorded.  On 10 January 2011 a wall of water swept through Toowoomba, then travelled west, flooding Oakey, Dalby, Chinchilla and Condamine for a second time, causing flooding through the Lockyer Valley, including Murphy&rsquo;s Creek, Postman&rsquo;s Ridge, Helidon, Grantham, Laidley, Lowood, Fernvale and Forrest Hill.  The floodwaters affected the Bremer, Lockyer and Brisbane River systems, reaching heights that engulfed Ipswich, Goodna, Gailes, Karalee and suburbs of Brisbane.  During this period approximately 3572 businesses were inundated.  There were 5900 people evacuated from 3600 homes. Commercial loss was approximately $4 billion across the mining, agriculture and tourism sectors. Nineteen thousand kilometres of roads were damaged. Three major ports were significantly affected. More than 28 per cent of the Queensland rail network was left twisted and displaced. An estimated 28,000 homes would need to be rebuilt while vast numbers of dwellings require extensive repairs.  The judicial inquiry into Queensland's floods started on 10 February 2011, a final report was published in March 2012.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimates the 2011 damage at $2.38 billion with an estimated total reserve of $3.71 billion. Further payouts will be made to claimants for progress payments for rebuilding and business interruption. The insurance costs totalled $1.33 billion for Cyclone Yasi. Areas as far south asæBrisbaneæwere affected by Tasha. There, roughly 1,100 emergency calls for help were made as hundreds of drivers became trapped on flooded roads.[15]æInNew South Wales, 175 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as the flooding spread south. An additional 800 people were isolated in the towns of Urbenville and Bonalbo on 28æDecember as flood waters blocked off roads.[12] By 28æDecember, nearly half of Queensland was flooded and preliminary damage estimates exceeded A$1.4æbillion. Total economic losses also reached A$6æbillion, roughly 0.5% of the nation'sægross domestic product.[16]æIn response to the severe flooding, the Government of Queensland declared numerous towns as disaster areas, allowing for federal funds to be used. By 27æDecember, flood waters began to recede in Babinda and Gordonvale, leaving behind debris and thick black mud.[10]æThe following day, Prime MinisterJulia Gillardæannounced that additionalæBlackhawk helicoptersæwould be sent to assist in evacuation efforts.[11]",30/11/2010,17/01/2011,January,2011,Queensland,Queensland,Queensland,,EM-Track; ICA; van den Honert and McAneney (2011); QLD flood history; EM-DAT; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Tasha; http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/cyclone-tasha-crosses-queensland-coast-20101225-19792.html,71,,,,,,,12000,200000,,,33,2387624000,2550000000,,,,18000,28000,29000,,,,,,,,,,3572,,,,19000km,,,,,,,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=501,EM-Track,ICA,9,14,50,69,77,121,,,,,,van den Honert and McAneney (2011),QLD flood history,EM-DAT507,Flood,Flood - Victoria Jan 2011,"Large amounts of tropical air combined with a low pressure trough brought heavy rain to areas of south-east Australia.

The state government further contributed $15 million to construct a 200 bed temporary accommodation for the community. The federal government committed to reimburse 50 per cent of the cost through the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements.&nbsp;  The Department of Housing allocated $9.5 million to repair the damaged roads and create new roads to the newly built replacement homes. The town also received more than $8 million from the federal government to help with recovery. The funding would be provided over two years under the Community Development Employment Projects program. Funds were allocated towards projects to enhance the economic and social development of the community, such as rebuilding and creating opportunities for locals to develop work skills to contribute to their community.

The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers' association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.

The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek&nbsp;broke its banks&nbsp;and flooded the town of&nbsp;Numurkah, north of Shepparton.&nbsp;Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with&nbsp;patients and residents evacuated.&nbsp;Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.  Flooding of Broken Creek, which flanks Nathalia, peaked on 9 March at 3.25 m. The town's evacuation notice was lifted 15 March 2012 and the metal levee dismantled on 20 March 2012.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $7,773,000 allocated to 6897 claimants.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2012 damage at $108.2 million which incorporated figures for both New South Wales and Victoria.",26/02/2012,15/03/2012,March,2012,Victoria Feb 2012,Victoria,Victoria,,EM-Track; BoM special report; SES annual report; ICA *one cost for VIC and NSW*,,,,,,,2,,,,,1,108212000,,1090,,,250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=615,EM-Track,BoM special report,9,29,48,,,,,,,,,SES annual report,,2029,Flood,Flood - Gippsland June 2012,"Commencing 4 June 2012, up to 200 mm of rain fell in eastern Victoria, breaking daily rainfall records for June at 23 locations across the state, mainly Gippsland. Many Gippsland locations received a month's rainfall in one day. Up to 100 residents in low-lying parts of Traralgon evacuated their homes when the Traralgon Creek flooded, 45 homes were flooded.  The main road through the region, the Princes Highway, was closed between Rosedale and Traralgon and also east of Orbost due to flood.&nbsp;Wind gusts of up to 150 km per hour brought down trees and blocked parts of the South Gippsland and Monaro highways.  Major flood warnings were issued for the Avon, Macalister, Mitchell, Thomson, Tanjil and Buchan Rivers and the Traralgon Creek. The Yallourn coal mine flooded when the Morwell River burst its banks on early June impacting on coal conveyers and therefore the operation of electricity generators. The operator TRUenergy announced it should be able to restore three of the plant's four generators by the end of June.  The State Emergency Service received 1200 requests for assistance across the state including 450 calls for trees that had fallen and blocked traffic.  Early estimates of flood damage are being assessed, but damage to council infrastructure alone is expected to exceed $10 million. The Department of Human Services paid out Government grants totaling $125,000 to flood-affected residents.  The Victorian Governments Deputy Premier Peter Ryan announced emergency flood assistance grants. Adults are entitled to $480 and children $240, up to a total of $1200.  A media release by the then Federal Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon on 28 June 2012 stated that Victorians affected by flooding in South-Eastern Metropolitan Melbourne and West Gippsland on 22-24 June 2012&nbsp;would be able to get financial assistance in the five local government areas of Baw Baw, Bass Coast, Cardinia, Latrobe and South Gippsland.

On 1 January 2012 Adelaide recorded its hottest New Year's Day since 1900 with a maximum temperature of 41.6 &ordm; C. On 2 January Mount Gambier reached a maximum of 41.7 &ordm; C and Renmark hit 42.3 &ordm; C. These temperatures prompted a South Australian power company to cut electricity supplies to approximately 3300 properties on the Fleurieu Peninsula on 2 January.  On 2 January Victoria recorded temperatures in the forties, with Melbourne reaching 40 &ordm; C and Dartmoor in the south-west recording the state&rsquo;s maximum of 43 &ordm; C. Victoria's ambulance service treated 45 patients for heat-related illnesses, including four cases of children left in cars. A 30 per cent increase in fainting episodes was experienced.  A spokesman for Life Saving Victoria reported 163 rescues occurred during the period 31 December to 2 January.  Approximately 450 people in Melbourne's outer west suburb of Sunbury were without power when a power kiosk failed to cope with the increased demand. A replacement kiosk was installed but caught fire soon after. A spokesman for the power company said an increase in consumption is believed to have caused the original outage.  In some regions on 2 January the temperature reached 40 &ordm; C, the wind speed was 50 km per hour and the relative humidity was at 21 per cent; creating extreme fire conditions. The Victorian Country Fire Authority responded to 200 fires throughout the state, including 21 grass fires. The worst fires were in the state's south-west, with the largest blaze in Koroit, which spread over 15 ha and took 15 crews and two aircraft to control.  A total fire ban was issued across most of Victoria and South Australia.  A severe fire warning was given to the central district and Victoria's north-western regions and the Country Fire Service ordered a total fire ban in 13 of the state's 15 districts.",30/12/2011,4/01/2012,January,2012,Southern Australia,South Australia; Victoria,South Australia,Victoria,EM-Track,,,,,,,1,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2118,Severe Storm,Severe Storm - Perth and Southern Western Australia,"Southern Western Australia experienced a number of widespread storms over a week commencing with a tornado hitting the Perth suburbs of Dianella and Morley on 7 June 2012. The tornado uprooted trees, brought down power lines, and lifted roofs from buildings. Reportedly the tornado only lasted approximately 10 minutes, but the winds up to 125 km per hour caused damage expected to be worth millions of dollars.  A further storm hit 10 June with winds of up to 140 km per hour lashing the south-west. Hundreds of power lines, street light wires and service wires came down in the storm. Some residents were warned they maybe without electricity for up to a week after more than 110,000 homes were affected. The weather bureau described the storm as a 'once in a decade' event.  In Bunbury, cars, buildings and infrastructure were damaged. Residents reported damage to houses, downed power lines, and debris spread across roads.  The State Emergency Service received hundreds of calls for help, mostly for damaged roofs and powerlines.  A man died after falling from a storm damaged roof south of Perth.  On 12 June, a third severe storm hit southern Western Australia in a week. Winds up to 113 km per hour, thunder and heavy rain caused power outages to 34,000 properties throughout the state. The storm hit the Perth metropolitan area at approximately 9.30 pm (AWST), bringing wind gusts of 107 km per hour as well as heavy rain and thunder for most of the night.  The Fire and Emergency Services Authority (FESA) answered more than 118 calls for help.  There was no major damage from the third storm.

The main fire that started near Forcett caused significant damage to local townships, particularly Dunalley, east of Hobart, where more than half of the town&rsquo;s buildings and a primary school were destroyed. Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4&nbsp;to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.&nbsp; Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000&nbsp;to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire. The fire burnt for up to two weeks and was handed back to regional firefighters when conditions eventually improved. The other significant fire front was at Bicheno and Coles Bay where up to 15 properties were lost.  These fires were described as the worst in almost half a century. On 14 January a Tasmanian Bushfire Recovery Taskforce was established and the state moved to recovery mode. The taskforce estimated that rebuilding communities could take up to two years, with contractors expected to start clearing damaged properties by the end of January.  Further information will be provided about the Tasmanian fires and resulting damage when available.",3/01/2013,14/01/2013,January,2013,Dunalley - Jan 2013,Tasmania,Tasmania,,EM-Track; EM-DAT; ICA,11,,,,,,2,1000,,,,1,89000000,,,,,,203,,212,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=3413,EM-Track,EM-DAT,9,17,,,,,,,,,,,,3437,Bushfire,Bushfire - Coonabarabran and New South Wales,"Bushfires started in the southern regions of New South Wales on 7 January 2013 when temperatures across the state reached 40 &deg;C and above. By 8 January more than 100 fires were burning throughout the state, including outer areas of Sydney, and at times 30 of these were not in control.  Many areas experienced fires including Bowning near Yass, Nowra, Tarcutta, Brogo, Carlaminda Cooma Monaro, Illawarra, Shoalhaven, Yarrabin and the Kybeyan Valley. Over the peak fire period approximately 131,000 hectares were burnt across the state.  One house was destroyed in Jugiong near the Australian Capital Territory border however, most losses were sustained in farming and agriculture, for example approximately 10,000 sheep were lost at an estimated cost of $1 million.  Up to 1600 firefighters worked to bring the fires under control and to build containment lines to protect property and prepare for worsening fire conditions. A volunteer firefighter sustained burn injuries in Gundaroo near Yass and was airlifted to the burns unit at Concord Hospital for treatment.  The weather conditions that fuelled fires in the south quickly moved north and fires started in the Hunter Valley, up to the Queensland border and west to Moree, Lithgow, Mudgee and Hargraves, among other regions.  On 9 January the Insurance Council of Australia stated in a media release that while to date no significant property loss had occurred in the New South Wales fires, people should remain vigilant as further severe fire conditions were forecast.  On 13 January a large, fast moving bushfire entered the Warrumbungle National Park near Coonabarabran in northern New South Wales. Specialist Rural Fire Service crews were flown into the fire zone to assist in what was described as atrocious fire conditions.  The fire left the National Park and destroyed more than 51 homes in nearby residential areas and damaged many others. Within days a recovery centre was opened in Coonabarabran to assist the local community.  The lodge at the Siding Spring Observatory in the National Park was damaged in the bushfire along with other buildings, but it is understood that the largest telescope in Australia, the Anglo-Australian Telescope, survived the fire.  On 15 January, the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, and the Federal Minister for Emergency Management, Nicola Roxon, announced Natural Disaster Assistance would be available to 51 Local Government Areas in New South Wales affected by bushfires.  By 19 January the Warrumbungle fire was still burning and escaped containment lines at Hickey Falls, approximately 30 km south-west of Coonabarabran, moving rapidly through grasslands. The Rural Fire Service stated properties were not threatened at that point; however the fire had burnt through 47,000 hectares.  A Recovery Coordinator Mr Steven Bradshaw was appointed to help with the bushfire recovery efforts concentrating in the Warrumbungle Shire as announced by Barry O&rsquo;Farrell on 21 January 2013.  The Department of Primary Industries stated that stock losses are still being assessed however losses across the state have now exceeded 12,000 head, which are mainly sheep and lambs. The farm infrastructure and fence damage from the New South Wales fire is extensive, with hundreds of kilometres of fences lost or damaged, hay supplies destroyed and farm structures such as sheds burnt and wildlife losses are also significant. The Department has teamed with farmers to establish a fodder and fencing donation register.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $1,015,600 put aside to pay over 830 claimants.  The Insurance Council of Australia declared the Coonabarabran bushfire a catastrophe and estimated the January 2013 damage at a preliminary cost of $12 million. Insurance losses from agriculture are not available at this stage. As at 4 March 2013, the revised estimated cost from the bushfire is $35 million.",7/01/2013,20/01/2013,January,2013,Coonabarabran and New South Wales,New South Wales,New South Wales,,EM-Track; EM-DAT; ICA,11,,,,,,2,,,,1,,35000000,,,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12000,,,,,,,,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=3437,EM-Track,EM-DAT,9,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bushfire,,,17/10/2013,27/10/2013,October,2013,,New South Wales,New South Wales,,ICA - estimated cost,,,,,,,,,,,,,183000000,183000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3487,Cyclone,Cyclone Oswald,"Tropical Cyclone Oswald formed in the Gulf of Carpentaria on 21 January 2013. It made landfall at night between Kowanyama,and Pormpuraaw on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, as a weak category one system with winds up to 100 km per hour. The following morning, as the cyclone moved inland it was downgraded to a tropical low system. The low moved toward the east coast, near Cooktown on 23 January and then tracked slowly to the south-south-east just inland from the coast, impacting areas near Townsville on 24 January. The weather system stalled over the St. Lawrence-Rockhampton area on the 25th and 26th, and then tracked south to near Dalby west of Brisbane on the 28th, finally accelerating in a southerly direction eventually moving offshore south of Sydney on the 29th.  The ex-tropical cyclone brought with it a heavy monsoonal rainfall system that lasted for approximately one week. Most of the eastern areas of Queensland, and the coast of New South Wales ending in the Wollongong area experienced very heavy rainfall during the period from 22 to 29 January 2013. On 25 January areas around Rockhampton recorded rainfall for a 24 hour period in excess of 300 mm. Rainfall for the areas between Rockhampton and Bundaberg alone were heavy enough to break the January monthly rainfall records. On 28 January the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Significant rainfall / flood totals include:    Rockhampton January daily rainfall record of 349 mm - previous record set 1896 at 267.5 mm.  Maryborough January rainfall record of 258.8 mm - previous record set 1893 at 250.7 mm.  Yeppoon 289 mm daily rainfall total.  Ingham and Tully, had near 1000 mm of rain in 3 days.  Burnett river at Bundaberg hit a record level of 9.3 m. Bremer river peaked at 13.9 m lower than the predicted 15 m.  Brisbane river at peaked at 2 m, below the predicted level of 2.6 m.  The Clarence River at Grafton peaked at 8.09 m &ndash; just below the flood levee wall.  Laidley creek had a record flood height of 9.26 m on 28 January (the previous record was set in January 2011 at 8.85 m).    Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops. Approximately 40 water rescues took place by State Emergency Service volunteers, including two women and a toddler who were airlifted from the back of a vehicle to safety.  Key infrastructure was damaged and destroyed, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The rail service was closed between Cairns and Townsville, the Weipa port shut down for several days, airlines cancelled many domestic flights between New South Wales and Queensland, travellers were stranded as they tried to return home after the long weekend, 200 schools were closed on the first day of school for the year and the worst ever power outages occurred in Queensland affecting 283,000 properties.  Heavy rainfall was accompanied by strong winds at many sites with wind gusts in excess of 100 km per hour, coastal storm surges and big waves, as well as a number of tornadoes, hitting particularly in the Bundaberg area.  On Sunday 27 January the system moved south impacting Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast with damaging to destructive winds, torrential rain, dangerous surf and tidal inundation for a 24 hour period. Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron.  While the Lockyer Creek, Bremer River and the Brisbane River flooded, impacts in Brisbane were not a severe as the 2011 floods. There were no reports of homes with water above floor level in Brisbane. Residents were told to conserve water when the Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where evacuations occurred, approximately 2000 in total. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to over 2900 calls for assistance, most in the north of the state and the Fire and Rescue Service helicopter evacuated campers stranded near Grafton. Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatened to sweep houses away. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe. Defence personnel, 180 in total, went house to house within an exclusion zone, conducting search and rescue operations. Defence personnel also helped to repair damaged infrastructure and clean people's homes as part of the initial recovery operation.  Financial assistance and grants were made available to eligible Queensland flood victims, including:    Queensland Floods Appeal 2013 payments  Emergent Assistance Grant  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)  Essential Services Safety and Reconnection Grant.    The Queensland government also provided financial help and support services to business owners and primary producers such as low interest loans and clean up and recovery grants. Other assistance included freight subsidies, Individual Disaster Stricken Property (IDSP) declarations and leasehold rent relief.  The Federal Attorney-General announced flood and storm victims, employees, small business persons and farmers could apply for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments:    New South Wales - January 2013: 14,323 claims granted, $16,575,400 scheduled to be paid.

Temperatures peaked throughout Australia, forcing the Bureau of Meteorology to add new colours (deep purple and pink) to its weather forecasting chart to record temperatures above 50&deg;C.  Australia&rsquo;s first six days of 2013 were among the hottest 20 days on record in terms of average maximums. The heatwave developed over a large region stretching from northern Victoria and inland New South Wales to central-west Queensland, across to north-western Western Australia and down to the Nullarbor coast.The national average maximum across Australia on 7 January was 40.33 &deg;C, beating the previous record set in 1972 by 0.16&deg;C.  In Perth, temperatures exceeded 37&deg;C for seven consecutive days. This heatwave caused 20 people to be hospitalised between the period 27 December and 3 January. St John Ambulance reported a doubling in call-outs for heatstroke, dehydration and burns from the previous week. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Western Australia recorded 42.1 &deg;C, 13 &deg;C above the December average. The state's average temperature for the last week of 2012 averaged a maximum of 39.3 &deg;C, making it the hottest week in 80 years.&nbsp;Records were broken in Alice Springs, with temperatures over 40 &deg;C for 17 days in a row and Oodnadatta, where temperatures exceeded 45 &deg;C for seven consecutive days.  On 17, January Sydney endured its hottest day ever, with a record temperature of 45.8 &deg;C. The Ambulance Service of New South Wales reported that more than 220 people had been treated for heat exposure or fainting. The heatwave stranded thousands of commuters, with dozens of trains delayed as steel wires buckled and a hose used to run a key signalling system melted. On the central coast, the heat caused an overhead wire to buckle onto a train at approximately 1.30 pm, trapping about 250 passengers for half an hour.  There was a noted increase in nationwide hospital admissions for kidney disease, acute renal failure and heart attacks across this period.
